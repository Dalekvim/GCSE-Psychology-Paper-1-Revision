                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Defining Criminality is difficult because it's a <b alt="Created by Sociaty">Social Construct</b>;
                    What was once a Crime, may not be Now, and what is Crime Now, may not be in the Future;
                    It all depends on the people at that point in time.
                    Eventhough this idea makes it hard to Identify what Traits make a Criminal
                    (As none can be <b alt="Same Everywhere">Universal<b>), we know that Crime comes in 5 basic types:
                    <br> 1. Violent
                    <br> 2. Drug-related
                    <br> 3. Aqusitive
                    <br> 4. Sexual
                    <br> 5. Anti-social
                    <br>
                    Along with this you will also need to remember Core Theory One:
                    The Social Learning Theory and Cooper & Mackie's Study to go with it,
                    and Core Theory Two:
                    Eysnerics's Theory on Criminal Personility along with Heaven's Study.<br>
                    If that wasn't enough, there's more;
                    You will also have to understand how rehabilitation and punishments reduce crime rates.<br><br>
