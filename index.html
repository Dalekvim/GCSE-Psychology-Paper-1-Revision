        <h1>Paper 1</h1>
        <p>
            As you probably know OCR Psychology is split into two papers:
            the first on Psychological Problems, Criminal Psychology and Developement;
            the second Social Influence, Sleep and Dreaming, and Memory.
            This website will hopefully contain all you need to revise for your test :-)
