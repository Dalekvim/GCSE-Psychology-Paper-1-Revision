            <p>
                As you probably know OCR Psychology is split into two papers:
                the first on Psychological Problems, Criminal Psychology and Developement;
                the second Social Influence, Sleep and Dreaming, and Memory.
                This website will hopefully contain all you need to revise for your test :-)
